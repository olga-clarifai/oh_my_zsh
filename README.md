# Automatic installation of Oh My Zsh

**[Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)** is a cool piece of software managing zsh configuration that makes your terminal shell colorful and powerful. 

This script installs Oh My Zsh and required fonts in one click. It sets up a nice color theme but preserves your current zsh configuration. In addition, Oh My Zsh offers a plugin for *git* that displays current branch and its status if it finds any *git* repository in the current path. 

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
